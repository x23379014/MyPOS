--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: MyPOS: Cloud-Based Point of Sale System
Subtitle: Django + AWS Cloud Services Integration

Student: [Your Name]
Course: [Course Name]
Date: [Date]

Key Points:
- Django-based POS system
- AWS cloud services integration
- Full CRUD operations
- Production deployment

================================================================================

SLIDE 2: ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: System Architecture & Design

Main Points:
1. Three-Tier Architecture
   - Presentation Layer (HTML/CSS + Django Templates)
   - Application Layer (Django Backend)
   - Data Layer (DynamoDB + SQLite + S3)

2. Design Patterns
   - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
   - Repository Pattern
   - Middleware Pattern
   - Error Handling Pattern

3. Architecture Diagram
   [Include your architecture diagram showing:]
   - Users → ALB → EC2 Instances → AWS Services
   - Services: DynamoDB, S3, SNS, CloudWatch, SQLite

Critical Analysis:
✓ Scalable architecture (horizontal scaling via ALB)
✓ Separation of concerns for maintainability
✓ Cloud-native design leveraging AWS managed services

================================================================================

SLIDE 3: CLOUD-BASED SERVICES & CRITICAL ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: AWS Cloud Services - Critical Analysis & Justification

Service 1: Amazon DynamoDB
- Purpose: Store customer and transaction data
- Justification: NoSQL for high-performance, scalable storage
- Analysis: Eliminates DB management, auto-scaling, millisecond latency

Service 2: Amazon S3
- Purpose: Store product images
- Justification: Cost-effective object storage, 99.999999999% durability
- Analysis: Reduces server storage, enables CDN integration

Service 3: Amazon SNS
- Purpose: Send transaction notifications
- Justification: Decoupled messaging, multiple subscribers
- Analysis: Future integration (email/SMS) without code changes

Service 4: Amazon CloudWatch
- Purpose: Monitor transaction metrics and dashboards
- Justification: Real-time monitoring, automated alerting
- Analysis: Operational insights, proactive issue detection

Service 5: Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Purpose: Distribute traffic across EC2 instances
- Justification: High availability, automatic failover
- Analysis: 99.99% uptime, handles traffic spikes

Why AWS?
✓ AWS Academy Learners Lab (free access)
✓ Comprehensive service ecosystem
✓ Industry-standard platform
✓ Excellent documentation

================================================================================

SLIDE 4: LIBRARY CREATION - CUSTOM ERROR HANDLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Custom Python Library - Error Handler

Library Name: error_handler

Purpose:
- Centralized error handling for AWS service interactions
- Convert AWS exceptions to user-friendly messages
- Consistent error logging across application

Key Features:
1. AWS Error Mapping
   - Maps AWS exceptions → Custom POSError
   - Context-specific error messages

2. Error Categories
   - AWSConnectionError (network issues)
   - AWSResourceError (resource not found)
   - AWSValidationError (invalid parameters)

3. Logging Integration
   - Logs errors with full context
   - Maintains error history

Rationale for Creating Library:
✓ Consistency: Single point of error handling
✓ Maintainability: Easy to update error messages
✓ User Experience: Clear, actionable messages
✓ Debugging: Comprehensive logging

Implementation:
- Published as reusable Python module
- Used across all AWS service interactions
- Extensible for future services

================================================================================

SLIDE 5: IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Implementation - Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements (CRUD Operations):

✓ Products Management
  - Create, Read, Update, Delete
  - Image upload to S3
  - SQLite storage

✓ Customers Management
  - Create, Read, Update, Delete
  - DynamoDB storage

✓ Transactions Management
  - Create transactions with multiple products
  - View transaction history
  - Real-time calculations
  - DynamoDB storage

Non-Functional Requirements:

✓ Performance: Fast response times (< 2 seconds)
✓ Reliability: Error handling, transaction rollback
✓ Security: CSRF protection, input validation
✓ Scalability: ALB ready, stateless design

Code Quality:
- Well-commented source code
- Modular design
- Django best practices
- Custom middleware for Cloud9

================================================================================

SLIDE 6: DEPLOYMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Deployment - Production Environment
